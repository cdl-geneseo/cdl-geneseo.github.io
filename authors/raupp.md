**Emma Raupp** is a senior English major and Philosophy minor. Last semester, she discovered her technical capability while working with [Digital Thoreau](http://digitalthoreau.org). She is excited to share what she’s learned so far with others in the hope that they, too, will be pleasantly surprised by all they are capable of doing with their computers. In addition to being a Student Affiliate for the Center for Digital Learning, she is a tutor at the [Writing Learning Center](https://www.geneseo.edu/english/writing_center). When she’s not reading or writing, she’s imagining ways to bring more art and empathy to schools of the future. Upon graduating this spring, she hopes to begin student teaching and use her free time to finally transcribe her thoughts into something meaningful.
