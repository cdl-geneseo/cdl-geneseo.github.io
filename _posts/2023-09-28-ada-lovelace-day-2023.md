<span class="drop">A</span>da Lovelace Day returns to Geneseo on October 12, 2023, in the MacVittie College Union Ballroom from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

Ada Lovelace Day is an [international celebration of the achievements of women in STEM](https://findingada.com) held each year since 2009 on the second Tuesday in October. Because that day coincides with Geneseo's fall break, we're marking ALD later that same week, after classes are back in session. But if you have a chance to check out the streaming events on October 10, we encourage you to do so!

Visit the CDL's [Ada Lovelace Day 2023 at SUNY Geneseo website](https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/ald) to learn about the planned activities, including presentations on [Visualizing Women in Science](https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/womeninscience/) and notable women in the history of physics and astronomy, a Wikipedia edit-a-thon, and a workshop on poetry and generative AI.

Everyone's welcome. Be sure to bring your laptop for the edit-a-thon!
