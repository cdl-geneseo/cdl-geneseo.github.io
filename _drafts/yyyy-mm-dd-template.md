<!-- 

You can create a post by copying this file and substituting the correct information in the YAML header at the top. Be sure to retain the three dashes (---) above and below!

Replace the comment content with your post content, written in markdown.

Save file with format yyyy-mm-dd-your-post-title.md 

For <yourname> use the lowercase, no spaces name you've been assigned as a CDL blogger.

For categories, choose been News and Perspectives. For tags, use existing tags if possible.

For the image at the top of your post, in place of a markdown link to an image file that you upload to the repo, you can use the html <img> tag to point to an image on the web. Be sure to include attribution either way and copyright status (public domain or creative commons in most cases).

No spaces in filenames and no punctuation other than hyphens and the period before the file extension!

The title and date you enter in the YAML header above will display as your post title and date when the post is published. The author name will display as well and, if you have a bio page, will link to it.
