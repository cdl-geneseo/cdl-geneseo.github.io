## Blog goals & principles

The CDL strives to keep its blog posts approachable, accessible, timely, and relevant. We're looking to post about topics that we think are of interest to our target audience—researchers, scholars, instructors, and other professionals interested in digital pedagogy and digital humanities—as well as representative of our center's mission and vision. Our blog reflects and communicates who we are, so what we share, and how we share it, should be carefully considered prior to any publications. 

## Voice and tone

The CDL blog should have a casual, approachable, and clear voice and tone to its posts. We highly encourage each writer to bring their personal voice to their posts with us. Our writers should avoid stiff, overly formal language, and should strive to be inclusive in the way they write.

We ask that you stick to the following elements:

**Use active voice.** Avoid passive voice. This makes the writing exceedingly easier to read.

**Invite the reader in.** Write in plain English. Using slang and jargon can alienate readers who might not understand. When you have to use these kinds of terms to get your point across, take the time to briefly define them for the reader.

**Write positively.** Use positive language rather than negative language.

## Grammar and mechanics

While we're not serious sticklers about grammar, there are some guidelines we have for writing on our platform in order to maintain general clarity and cohesiveness.

### Basics

**Write for all readers.** Some people will read every word you write. Others will just skim. Help everyone read better by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers. Read more about the importance of headers under [Markdown requirements](#markdown-requirements).

**Be concise.** Use short words and sentences. Avoid unnecessary modifiers.

**Be specific.** Avoid vague language. Lead with your point.

**Be consistent.** Checking back with this guide as you write can help with this. 

### Abbreviations and acronyms

If your piece includes abbreviations and acronyms, always spell out the entire acronym the first time you mention it, immediatey following it up with the shorthand in parenthesis. 

**Ex.**

This is a style guide for the Center for Digital Learning (CDL) blog.

### Punctuation

#### Colons, commas, and semicolons

Use **colons** to indicate a list.

**Ex.**

Erin ordered 3 kinds of donuts: glazed, chocolate, and pumpkin.

Colons can also join two related but separate phrases.

**Ex.**

I was faced with a dilemma: I wanted a donut, but I’d just eaten a bagel.

Please use the serial **comma**, which is also known as the Oxford comma.

If you find yourself using a lot of **semicolons** your sentence is probably too long and complicated. Try to simply!

#### Dashes and hyphens

Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into single phrase, or to indicate a span or range.

**Ex.**

- first-time user
- Monday-Friday

Use an em dash (—) without spaces on either side to offset an aside.

**Ex.**

Austin thought Brad was the donut thief, but he was wrong—it was Lain.

### Capitalization

Our team prefers to keep unnecessary capitalization to a minimum. This includes not capitalizing random words in the middle of sentence.

**Ex.**

- internet
- the college (when referring to Geneseo, for example)
- tweet
- blog

And the like.

#### Title case

We're big fans of sentence case around here. We think it looks nice. When writing out the titles for your posts, please follow sentence case, only capitalizing the first word and any proper nouns.

### Numbers

Sometimes you wonder if you should type the numeral or write out the word for a number when you're using it in a sentence. It can be a difficult call at times. Here's our preference: 

- If a number starts off a sentence, write it out.
- If a number exceeds 10, write it out.
- If a number is part of an expression but doesn't match the above rules (e.g. high-five), keep it written out. A general rule of thumb: if it looks weird, it probably is.

### Words and terms to avoid

When possible, avoid using words like blacklist, whitelist, grandfathered, slave, master, deaf, blind and any other racist or abelist terms, especially when not using them literally.

## Using images

We encourage you to find an image (or two!) to go with your posts. It makes it more eye-catching! 

However, when choosing your image, if you don't own it, it must be openly licensed or in the public domain. Some sites we recommend for finding openly licensed images include:

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is great for high resolution photographs licensed CC0 (free! :wink:)
- [Creative Commons search](http://search.creativecommons.org/)
- [Google image search](https://www.google.com/imghp) with Creative Commons usage rights
    - Type in desired image subject and search
    - On the following search results page, click on the "Tools" button beneath the search bar at the top of the page
    - Click on the "Usage Rights" drop down bar
    - Select "Creative Commons licenses"

## Markdown requirements

The CDL's blog is run on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdl-geneseo/cdl-geneseo.github.io), and so needs to be written in Markdown, which is a plain text formatting language. 

While we encourage our writers to try writing in this truly simple, if a little unfamiliar to most, format, we are also happy to accept Google Doc or Microsoft Word submissions.

In either case, we do request that you follow the following formatting requirements to streamline the posting process:

1. Split your posts into headings: H1,H2,H3,etc.
    
    a. In Markdown, this is done by adding #'s and a space 

2. Embed links as *hyperlinks*, do not simply paste the full URL.
3.
