*Happy first birthday to us!*{:.image-caption}

<span class="drop">W</span>here has the time gone? 

This week marks the CDL's first year of existence. In this time, we sought to develop our [mission statement](https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl), as well as create our leadership organizational structure and collaborative partnerships with other highly regarded and effective departments on campus such as CIT, TLC, CDL, Milne Library, and DAPA. We also aimed to establish an online presence through [our website](https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl) and other forms of communication, develop a strategic plan for the future of digital learning at Geneseo, and launch workshops to help faculty, staff, and students increase their knowledge of and facility with digital tools for teaching, scholarship, creative practice, and productivity.

We have lots of plans as we look forward toward our second year. Overall, we're looking foward to moving past the "pandemic mode" that we operated in for much of our first year. We learned a lot from this work as a center, and we're eager both to continue supporting the structures that we helped put in place during this time and to build on these services in an increasingly in-person capacity. 

Stick with us this semester to see the cool things we have in store! :sunglasses: 

And have a treat to celebrate our birthday &hellip; maybe you can stop by in person for next year's celebration! :birthday:

<!-- Some involve continuing what we've been working on up to this point, such as writing and publishing blog posts here and leading workshops for staff, faculty, and students. -->
