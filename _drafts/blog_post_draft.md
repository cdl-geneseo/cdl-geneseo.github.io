# Exploring the Socioeconomic Issues Present in Modern Technology 

## The Humanities are Intertwined with Technology 

In recent years, technological advances have paved the way for the emphasis on all things internet. As a result, the education of society's up-and-coming technology trailblazers is being thrust into questioning. Due to the rapid technological advancements that have occurred over the years, new technology students bear different burdens than those before them. 

As Sylvester A. Johnson - director of the Virginia Tech Center for Humanities - discusses, the coursework of future technologists should be inclusive to prevent bias. As he elaborates in the [Price Lab Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/price-lab/price-lab-podcast-ep-8-pt-1-sylvester-a-johnson), it is "urgent that we have some type of broad, transdisciplinary inclusion in the people who are going to determine the future of this technology because that is gonna have a lot to do with shaping the world we live in." As Johnson emphasizes, it is important to address bias and minimize its effects since the presence of bias in technology has the power to shape the world. Since it is apparent that technology plays an important role in our lives, bias among individuals in the technology field can alter our experiences with technology and thus, alter our lives. To remedy these effects, Johnson claims that the technology field should not only be about technological knowledge, but the effects of using technology and its socioeconomic implications. 

## The Social Issues Associated with Technology 

In regards to the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), the interdisciplinary approach is a more recent perpective and people like Johnson are working towards changing that. Since typical STEM programs concentrate on teaching math and science, these discplines inherently ignore humanist ideals. This results in "problems of racial and gender bias in algorithms or the user interface or the applications that create tremendous social problems" (Johnson). In other words, Jonhson claims that because STEM students are not always required to take courses outside of their major that emphasize human rights, they end up creating biased technology. 

For more than fifteen years, there has been frequent complaints about the racism embedded in Facebook's algorithm so Johnson uses Mark Zuckerberg's mistakes as an example. Since Zuckerberg created Facebook in 2004, a time before the internet merged into our daily lives, it makes sense that there would be instances of racial bias observed in the interface and algorithm. As inclusion is at the forefront of everyone's minds, it has become more and more apparent that we cannot keep placing blame on these systems for the racial bias in technology. Instead, we must work to change the environment that fosters these biases to make technology user-friendly and a positive experience for all. 

In an attempt to change that environment, the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ach) have recently released ["Toward anti-racist technical terminology."](https://ach.org/toward-anti-racist-technical-terminology/) In this announcement, ach recognizes the racially charged terminology in technology and explains their biased history in order to spread awareness and influence change. For example, they remind us that a "blacklist” is a list of people who are not allowed access. A whitelist is a list where only those on the list can have access" ("Toward anti-racist..."). These terms echo the perspectives of segregationists who believe that Black people should not have access to the same infrastructure, public transportation or eateries as white people. Using racially charged language like this functions to create an association among the phrases "black" and "no access." These types of implications are dangerous as they may shape how someone views "black," whether the color or the race. 

## The Economic Issues Associated with Technology 

Accompanied with the social issues present in technology, the economic issues associated with technology prevent everyone in society from having a positive experience. As Alana Semuels explains in ["Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the Pandemic—And Robots and AI Are Replacing Them Faster Than Ever,"](https://time.com/5876604/machines-jobs-coronavirus/) COVID-19 protocols have opened the door for artificial intelligence (AI) and robots in the workplace. Considering the fact that COVID-19 is so easily transmitted, millions were either laid off, furloughed, or put on (paid/unpaid) leave. This left many jobs empty and in need of workers, yet no company could reassemble their employees due to COVID-19 guidelines. 

To replace human workers, robots were stationed at various workplaces and  "they were suddenly cleaning floors at airports and taking people’s temperatures," delivering "towels and toothbrushes" in hotels, and running entire farms (Semuels). In this circumstance, the use of robots emphasizes the weaknesses of human beings such as the fact that humans can catch and transmit COVID-19 while robots cannot. When those weaknesses are exposed and humans are no longer considered fit for the job, employers replace them. While the adoption of AI in the workplace is not a new concept, it has increased to fit the needs of society in recent years. While thousands are displaced by the use of AI in a given organization, companies claim "they’re freeing up humans to do more sophisticated tasks," such as enroll in college, attempt to learn new industry skills or enter a new specialty entirely (Semuels). Yet, the reality is that some may not have access to further education or training. Even though the pandemic [accompanied with AI] has caused a huge uprise in unemployment rates, it is hard for companies to let the AI go.  

Undeterred by the unfortunate circumstances of the recent addition of AI in professional environments, some companies may seek to continue replacing employees even after we return to "normalcy". Replacing employees with technology is a good business maneuver because the tax breaks that the United States government gives to companies make the idea of automation more appealing. CEOs now have the responsibility of determining if the well-being and job status of their employees **or** the tax breaks are more important to them and the development of the company. As Johnson reminds us, challenges in technology "will determine whether, and how many, people will be treated as expendable in this future economy." So we must ask ourselves, who is in charge of determining who is expendable? What makes people in certain fields more expendable than others? 

## Conclusion 

In the face of the rapid technological improvements and society's growing dependence on the internet, I would expect the same amount of development in regards to the technology discipline. Yet, this is not the case as Sylvester A. Johnson and others work to shift the focus of STEM learning towards the humanities. The lack of a transdisciplinary courseload leads to issues often displayed in social media platforms such as [the overpolicing of Black users,](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter) [lack of representation for people of color,](https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528) and [limitations that Black users face.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2020/04/14/does-tiktok-have-a-race-problem/#1e2351373260) Although technology can function to improve the quality of our lives, streamline boring work and increase efficiency,
it is worthless if humanist perspectives are not taken into account. After all, technology is a detriment to society when humanistic values are ignored.
