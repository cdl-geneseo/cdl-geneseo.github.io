**Amanda Wentworth Schmidt**, Assistant to the Director of the [Center for Digital Learning](https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl) and Digital Humanities and Learning Coordinator, graduated from SUNY Geneseo in 2018 with a BA in English Literature. As a student, she worked in various spaces to develop educational accessibility, a key tenet of the Open Educational Resource (OER) movement, including the [Livingston County Historical Society](https://www.livingstoncountyhistoricalsociety.com/), for which she revived and redesigned its “Home and Hearth” exhibit, adding an interactive digital interface and strategically organizing its collection to tell a more cohesive historical narrative. Amanda also utilized innovative digital tools to share the story of [The Soldier Librarian](http://slob.coplacdigital.org/geneseo/) at Geneseo through her participation in a Spring 2017 [COPLACDigital](http://coplacdigital.org/) course, [The Social Life of Books](http://slob.coplacdigital.org/). Before joining the CDL, Amanda worked at Geneseo for SUNY OER Services as their OER Publishing Coordinator, supporting faculty across all 64 institutions in the publication and printing of over 75 openly licensed textbooks.
